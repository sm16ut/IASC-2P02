## Bio

I am a second-year student currently enrolled in the Interactive Arts and Science program at Brock University. During my time attending in the 2P02 course I found that the research areas that interested me were open access publishing and data visualization. The data visualization research area is directly reflected in my blog post where I decided to use voyant tools to create a visual representation of words that are consistently used giving the reader an idea of what the Duckers work will be focusing on. For the group project my team and I decided to work with Zotero a free open-source reference manager that makes a great addition as an academic tool for any student trying to keep their work and citations organized. For my portion on the group project I got the chance to gather some images and create a short video to give a small tutorial on how to use the program, this directly reflects open access publishing as well as data visualization. I am always learning of new open access software’s and websites, which is why I wish to keep working with them to hone my skills with certain programs as well as directing my peers to helpful tools for a specific academic utility. Representing data visually has always interested me due to there being no boundaries on how data can be translated visually, I hope to find new and creative ways of representing data outputs in my future work. 


## Featured Project: [Blog Post]

Cirrus from my blog post. (represents frequency in words)

For my featured project I decided to showcase and rework/improve on my blog post assignment. The following blog post project touches on Drucker and Ramsays work touching on data and capta, their differences, and then followed by two visual representations of these terms using voyant-tools.  I argued in my blog post that as an individual living a technological society being familiar with these terms can greatly benefit the modern person do get an idea of what the purpose of this information will be used for and if there is an already biased decision being made for you without your knowledge. The reason I decided to showcase this project was its direct relation to one of my research areas of interest ‘data visualization’. I chose to use the voyant-tools to show the meaning of capta and explain how an individuals’ ideologies can influence a different combination of words differ to my chosen combination. To represent data, I used a Cirrus which chose re-occurring words in Duckers work then bolded and expanded the more common words in the text. This information already being given makes it data since the user/viewer can’t do anything to directly influence the outcome of the information output. 

Looking back at this project its research and findings are as concrete as they were when I first encountered them. Examples of data and capta can be seen in a daily occasion from multiple different sources, either it being rankings of teams of the NHL on the internet, or an optional paper survey that one can take for a gift card at your favorite café. When I decided to revise my blog project I noticed a lot of small grammar errors that needed to be corrected, I felt this was necessary to maintain the post integrity as a university leveled paper. One can see the corrections in the following commit. [here](https://github.com/sm16ut/IASC-2P02/commit/57baf2e1a96cba37514697d9b7e5879c9055b70a)
While reviewing my past work I noticed my argument could do with more backing and solid points, so I decided to add a paragraph and a few sentences to solidify this topic further. One can see the paragraph and a couple of sentences I added on the first commit. On the following commit you will notice a few extra sentences I decided to add  to strengthen my argument. [here](https://github.com/sm16ut/IASC-2P02/commit/57baf2e1a96cba37514697d9b7e5879c9055b70a)
Finally, for my last modification of my featured project I decided I would restructure any awkward sentences as well as add additional phrases to make the overall flow of the post more fluent. The changes can be seen in the following commit posted. [here](https://github.com/sm16ut/IASC-2P02/commit/1ed0975811a3c705736590367286e96aa0cb3cce)
Revisiting this project gave me new ideas on how I might been able to display this data in none traditional ways, I look forward on being able to visually display this type of data in future projects. 

## Collaborative Project

While working on the assigned group project, my team and I decided to do our presentation on the free open-source reference manager ‘Zotero’. I got given the task on creating a tutorial for people interested in the application by using a collection of images(see image Commits below) as well a video(Image Below) that I voiced over during the presentation. Zotero having so many utilities made it difficult for me to give a comprehensive tutorial in less than 5 minutes, due to this I decided to focus and explain on Zoteros focus and keep it short and comprehensive.  

The portion of the presentation I got assigned did not require too much of my team members attention. From the first date that we got the assignment I made sure to communicate to my group my idea for a tutorial utilizing images and video. My group and I discussed possible ways of delivering this task and we decided I would use a live voice over a prerecorded and images showing helpful tools to note in the Zotero app. Between the date that this presentation was assigned and the date that it was due, I had to communicate with my group briefly via Facebook group chat. There we would discuss who needed assistance, if there was any portion that needed being done to complete another, and decisions on the overall structure of the final presentation. I believe the method decided for showcasing the Zotero application was more than adequate, doing a real-time voice over gave me the advantage on focusing on what my team and I agreed was important information to share. Once every group member had finished their assigned portion of the presentation, we all decided on meeting up to put our parts together. In this time, we we’re all able to express our opinions on each other’s work and make changes if needed. Overall, I think this group project went well with every team member fulfilling their task and collaborating on creating a final presentation we could all be proud of.

Here is an image of the video tutorial I created. As one can see it shows all Zoteros interface as well as how to find certain citations or bookmarks you have made.
