# Taken & Given


For the following project I decided to take a closer look at Johanna Druckers ‘Humanities Approaches to Graphical Display’.Druckers article touches upon tools that the digital humanities have adopted to help visualize their work. We are also introduced to data and capta, two terms that share base similarities. The two terms data and capta are similar in the sense that they are both form of information; the difference is that one of these informations is given by the user(data) and the other is taken (capta). User R_BAIG touches on the subject and does great job a in depth explanation of the differences between these two terms. "data is supposed to be a sort of “given.” For example, somebody runs a mile and you time them with a stop-watch, and once they finish, you measured their time as 4 minutes and 14 seconds, that data is given to you. On the other hand, capta is “taken” actively. To me, I would classify “capta” as what is used in the process of creating a visual representation of such thing, using data to aid in the creation." (R_Baig).
Data vs Capta was new to me, and I agreed that a given can be also set on a personal ideology as the taken has a fine line of being a little more unbiased. Therefore, I choose to use the following voyant-tools to represent the argument that information given by a user can be morphed differently by his or hers set of ideologies.
The first show cased visual representation is a Cirrus. The purpose of this tool is to give the reader a better understanding of the core topic of Druckers work. By choosing the most re-according words and enlarging them the reader can get a sense of the core topic of  Druckers text. This cirrus tool could be classified as capta since I am directly taking these visual representations by a program from the source without user modification. From the many words that were given I decided to select the words I personally found represented Druckers work for me. This is an example of data due to the visualization being generated from individuals given information instead of a taken.

Everyone has a different way of viewing an item depending on there ideoligies and state of mind, for example if it’s a food or a text an individual is always going to have a personal experience with this item differing from another person. Stephen Ramsay touches on subject in his book ‘Reading Machines’.
“By one definition of the term, "deformation" suggests nothing more than
the basic textual maneuvers by which form gives way to form-the "de"
functioning not as a privative, but as relatively straightforward signifier of
change. But any reading that undertakes such changes (as all reading must)
remains threatened with the possibility that deformation signals loss, corruption,
and illegitimacy. Even now, in our poststructuralist age, we speak of
"faithfulness" to a text, of “flawed" or "misguided" readings, but any marking
of a text, any statement that is not are-performance of a statement, must break
faith with the ability of the text to mean and re-guide form into alternative intelligibilities” (Ramsay) 
Both Ducker and Ramsay agreed that text and data can be misguided by alternative intelligibilities, meaning that each individual person will decide on choosing different samples of data or text depending on how their mind works to make a topic stand out. It is worth mentioning that there are strategies that companies use in surveys, and interviews, etc. Which work to keep them transparent with an already planned out outcome of what they would be portrait as. With each individual having a different set on intelligibilities some may grasp what these people are trying to do and some may not.

(Figure 1) One of the points Ducker makes in her work is that in the changing forms of knowledge and representations of knowledge we must focus on adapting to it appropriately. The following Cirrus us a visual representation on the key elements Duckers work will be focusing on. Some words that stand out and should be considered are: Graphical, Information, Knowledge, Display, Data, Humanistic, and Time. The following words give the viewer a solid sense in what one could expect the main topic to be when reading Duckers article. This visualization was taken directly from her article which it then chooses the most re-occurring words and post them, either making them bolder and bigger depending on their frequency. This could also be a visual representation of capta since this was directly taken from duckers work as opposed to being manually inputed by an individual.

(Figure 2) The final figure shows five select words that I decided represented Duckers work more accurately to me on a personal account.  Although there could be many factors on what influenced me to choose the following words there are a few that I know of. The amount spent reading a certain portion of text could have stuck with me better than a different portion. In class discussions on certain topics of the text, as well as portions that interested me more than others played a vital role in my ability to recall them. This visual representation is an example of data since I directly gave it the information to display instead of taking the information from an already given source. If this visual representation was to be completed by all of my peers in the 2P02 course the chosen combination of words would line up differently for each individual. Being independent beings with different ideologies would encourage each person to choose a different combination of words that personally stood out to them.  

While working on this blog post I got the opportunity to differentiate the difference between capta & data while also getting the chance to visually represent the two using voyant-tools. Being already familiar with data and its definition, made getting a grasp of the term capta that much simpler for me. I personally believe that getting familiar with these two terms could better a person understanding of data outputs and their true purpose to the viewer/user. Due to us living in a time where people will willingly give out their information, and have information taken from them it would be wise to know the intent of these actions. These two terms could also help an individual identify a companies scheme of asking for surveys that have an already set positive opinion of themselves or their services.
